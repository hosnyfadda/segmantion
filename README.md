![Demo Preview](demo.gif)  
*Replace your webcam background in real-time with any image!*

## Overview

This project implements a **real-time background replacement system** using Python, OpenCV, and the `cvzone` library. It captures live video from the webcam, removes the background with the SelfiSegmentation module, and replaces it with a custom image of your choice.

The goal is to demonstrate how to build efficient, real-time background segmentation and replacement â€” useful for virtual backgrounds in video conferencing, creative video effects, and augmented reality applications.

## Features

- Real-time background removal using AI-powered segmentation  
- Custom background image replacement (supports any image)  
- Smooth video feed with FPS (frames per second) display  
- Easy to extend and customize for your own use cases
